## Intro
JavaScript has so many built-in data types - custom types not even considered - that it would be nearly impossible to keep an up-to-date list of potential return values for `getType()`. The aim of the following pages is to give you look-up tables for the most common types. There isn't a `get<type>()` function for every type; I rather tried to cover those that I considered useful. The functions lean more towards browser implementations than NodeJS, but the code is fully functional under NodeJS as well. You won't find things like `isBuffer()` or `isDirectory()` though. Contributions are welcome (License: MIT). 

Let's start with primitive types - or at least some of them.

### Primitive Types (some)

| Input value     | Return value | Function        |
|:----------------|:-------------|:----------------|
| `true`          | `Boolean`    | `isBoolean()`   |
| `false`         | `Boolean`    | `isBoolean()`   |
| `null`          | `Null`       | `isNull()`      |
| `undefined`     | `Undefined`  | `isUndefined()` |
| `Symbol("bar")` | `Symbol`     | `isSymbol()`    |

### Common Types that didn't fit anywhere else

| Input value       | Return value | Function     |
|:------------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| `new Date()`      | `Date`       | `isDate()`   |
| `new Blob(...)`   | `Blob`       | `isBlob()`   |
| `/a/g`             | `RegExp`     | `isRegExp()` |
| `new RegExp(...)` | `RegExp`     | `isRegExp()` |
| `new Error()`     | `Error`      | `isError()`  |
